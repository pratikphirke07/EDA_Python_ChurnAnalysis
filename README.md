EDA - Customer Churn Analysis using Python

## What is Customer churn?
* Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a specific period of time. It's a critical metric for businesses as it reflects customer satisfaction, loyalty, and the overall health of the business. High churn rates indicate that a significant number of customers are leaving, which can signal problems with the product, service, or customer experience. Reducing churn is essential for sustaining growth, profitability, and long-term success.
